## What I Learned:

## My Best Moment Today:
- Football training

## My Biggest Challenge:
- Begin to do the Tarea 2 of Pensamiento Crítico

## How I Felt Overall:
- Was sensible today. Felt very good while exercising and showering. Then I managed to do a decent presentation (at least original and aligned with my identity) in ET.

## What I Can Improve:
- I pretend not taking things personally. People just say things, It's my responsibility to not let them turn

## Today’s Accomplishments:
- [ ] List what I achieved today
