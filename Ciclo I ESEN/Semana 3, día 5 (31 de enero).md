## Schedule:
- Math, clase 9
	- División sintética o regla de Ruffini
	- Cocientes notables
- Leadership, class 9
	- Dynamics (under third place)

## What I Learned:
- Usar la división sintética para dividir polinomios con divisor lineal
- Divisiones frecuentes con una respuesta que sigue un patrón

## My Best Moment Today:
- I was very happy in Math class, I was in the flow.

## My Biggest Challenge:
- Krosty told me I made her feel guilty and that made me feel bad.

## How I Felt Overall:
- Happy in Math class, strugging a little after Kros's message. The dynamics left me feeling isolated, I somewhat feel like I'am not part of the team, or at least I'm not as important as the others, I'm the black sheep.

## What I Can Improve:
- I can be proactive in the next dynamics. I think I isolate myself. I am a natural leader, it's a waste to be a shy boy.
- In rome, do as romans do. Kros is not as sensitive as me, she is more cold, maybe I should adapt to her, instead of trying to change who she is.
