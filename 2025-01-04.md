2. Created view `registro.php`
3. Create view `dashboard.php`
4. Created function to verify credentials on `UsuarioModel`

4. Display lodgings in the view `dashboard.php`

**Notes/Reflections**
- With the new system of goals and time measurement, I felt less anxious, was more productive, and was more satisfied at the end of the day.
- This day flew by. I only had enough time to do the afternoon pomodoro.
