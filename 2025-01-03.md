## **End-of-Day Review**

**Today's Accomplishments**
1. I've created the `UsuarioModel` class, whose CRUD methods I'll use for the login system.
2. I've created the `UsuariosAlojamientosModel` class, whose CRUD methods I'll use for the user dashboard.
3. I set up a plan to get into a state of flow while working.

**Unfinished Tasks**
- Still need to finish writing the [[Specific goals]] for the project `Alojamientos App` 

**Challenges & Lessons Learned**
- I struggled to focus on the project because I was working on the run, without a plan.
- Struggled with understanding MySQL joins for the dashboard data.

**Goals for Tomorrow**
1. Create view `login.php`
2. Create view `registro.php`
3. Finish writing the [[Specific goals]] for the project `Alojamientos App`
